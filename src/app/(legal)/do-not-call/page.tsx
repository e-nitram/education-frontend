<h3 className='text-md font-semibold'>Right To Request Correction Of Inaccurate Personal Or Sensitive Personal Information</h3>
<p>
  You have the right to request correction of inaccurate personal and/or sensitive personal
  information that we collect. Upon receiving a verifiable consumer request for correction, we will
  make commercially reasonable efforts to correct information identified as inaccurate. Where we
  correct inaccurate personal and/or sensitive personal information, we shall instruct all service
  providers and/or contractors that maintain such personal and/or sensitive personal information in
  the course of providing services to us to make the necessary corrections in their respective
  systems.
</p>
        <h3 className='text-md font-semibold'>Exercising Access, Data Portability, Right To Correct And Deletion Rights</h3>
<p>
  To exercise your access, data portability, right to correct and/or deletion rights described above,
  please submit a verifiable User request to us by either:
</p>
<ul className='list-disc pl-5'>
  <li>Filling out form at the top of this page</li>
  <li>Calling us at: 877-835-5785</li>
  <li>Emailing us at: info@educationdirectory.net or</li>
  <li>Sending us U.S. mail to: 3219 E Camelback Rd Ste 221, Phoenix, AZ 85018</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on
  your behalf, may make a verifiable User request related to your personal information.
</p>
<p>
  You may only make a verifiable User request for access or data portability twice within a
  12-month period. The verifiable User request must:
</p>
<ul className='list-disc pl-5'>
  <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person
about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
  <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
  your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to
  you. Making a verifiable User request does not require you to create an account with us. We will
  only use personal information provided in a verifiable User request to verify the requestor's
  identity or authority to make the request.
</p>

<h3 className='text-md font-semibold'>Response Timing And Format</h3>
<p>
  We endeavor to respond to all verifiable User requests within forty-five (45) days of the receipt
  thereof. If we require more time (up to ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and
  extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at
  your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12) month period preceding
  the receipt of your verifiable request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we
  cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
  to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the
  information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
</p>
<p>
  We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable User request unless it is
  excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee,
  we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
  completing your request.
</p>

<h3 className='text-md font-semibold'>Authorized Agents</h3>
<p>
  Users may permit an authorized agent to exercise any rights granted under the CCPA and CPRA
  as set forth above. Any individual acting on your behalf as an agent must register with the
  California Secretary of State. Further, in order to utilize an authorized agent, you must provide
  the authorized agent with written permission from you to act on your behalf for these purposes.
  When you use an authorized agent to submit a request to delete, request to correct or a request to
  know, we may require the authorized agent to provide proof that you gave the agent signed
  permission to submit the subject request. We may also require you to do either of the following:
  (a) verify your own identity directly with us; or (b) directly confirm with us that you provided
  the authorized agent permission to submit the request.
</p>
        <h3 className='text-md font-semibold'>Non-Discrimination</h3>
<p>
  We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA and/or CPRA rights.
  Unless permitted by the CCPA and/or CPRA, we will not:

<ul className='list-disc pl-5'>
  <li>Deny you goods or services;</li>
  <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting
discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties;</li>
