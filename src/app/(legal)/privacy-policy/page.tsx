          also combine the information we have gathered about you with
          information from other sources.

        <p>
          By submitting your personal information by and through the Site

          information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that
          we maintain any personal information offline). Where our

          collected from an automated license plate recognition system or Social

        <p>
          Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take

          User personal information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the
          security and privacy of all User personal information. Employees not
          adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. The
          servers that we store User personal information on are kept in a
          secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place

          Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access
          to certain portions of your personal information, and technological
          bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your
          personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach

          <li>
